        quat : None | array_like, shape (4,) or (n_selected_envs, 4), optional
            The target orientation, either shared by every selected environment or given per environment. If None,

        local_point : None | array_like, shape (3,), optional
            A point in the link's local frame to be positioned at `pos`. If None, the link origin is used. This is
            useful for positioning a tool center point (TCP) or fingertip that is offset from the link origin. Defaults
            to None (equivalent to [0, 0, 0]).
        init_qpos : None | array_like, shape (n_dofs,), optional
            Initial qpos used for solving IK. If None, the current qpos will be used. Defaults to None.

            Rotation tolerance for normalized rotation vector error (in radian). Defaults to 1e-4.
        pos_mask : list, shape (3,), optional
            Mask for position error. Defaults to [True, True, True]. E.g.: If you only care about position along x and
            y, you can set it to [True, True, False].
        rot_mask : list, shape (3,), optional
            Mask for rotation axis alignment. Defaults to [True, True, True]. E.g.: If you only want the link's Z-axis

        max_step_size : float, optional
            Maximum step size in q space for each IK solver step. Defaults to 0.5.
        seed : None | int, optional

        dofs_idx_local : None | array_like, optional
            The indices of the dofs to set. If None, all dofs will be set. Note that here this uses the local `q_idx`,
            not the scene-level one. Defaults to None. This is used to specify which dofs the IK is applied to.
        return_error : bool, optional
            Whether to return the final errorqpos. Defaults to False.
        envs_idx: None | array_like, optional
            The indices of the environments to set. If None, all environments will be set. Defaults to None.
