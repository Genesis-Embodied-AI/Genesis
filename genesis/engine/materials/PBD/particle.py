class Particle(Base):
    """
    The liquid material class for PBD.

    Note
    ----
    This creates particle-based entities that has no inter-particle interaction at all; i.e. it is only affected by external forces.
    This is useful for creating particle-based animations.
    This material will be handled by the PBD solver, but there's actually nothing to solve really. It's just hosted under the PBD system.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rho: float, optional
        The rest density. Default is 1000.0.
    sampler: str, optional
        Particle sampler ('pbs', 'regular', 'random'). Default is 'pbs'.
