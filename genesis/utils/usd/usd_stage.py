    """
    Parse a USD stage and extract all rigid entities (articulations and rigid bodies) as separate USD morphs.

    This function uses a graph-based approach to identify connected components:
    - Joints are edges, links (rigid bodies referenced by joints) are nodes
    - Each connected component becomes one articulation entity
    - Pure rigid bodies (not referenced by any joint) become separate entities

    Joint prims are not stored on morphs; they are deduced dynamically when each
    entity is parsed via parse_usd_rigid_entity.

    Parameters
    ----------
    stage : gs.morphs.USD
        The USD morph containing the stage to parse. The morph must have a valid `usd_ctx`
        attribute that provides access to the USD context.
