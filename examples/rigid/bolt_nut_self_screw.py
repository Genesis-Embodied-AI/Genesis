"""Nut screwing itself down a fixed bolt via non-convex thread contact.

The bolt and nut are procedurally generated with matching ISO-metric-style threads (see
genesis/assets/meshes/bolt_nut/generate_bolt_nut.py) and loaded with convexify=False so
the full helix drives collision. The bolt is fixed, shaft up; a steady torque (a wrench)
turns the nut, whose threads convert the rotation into descent until it seats on the head.

Three details matter: decimate=False (the default decimation would erase the helix),
a stiffened constraint_timeconst (the default contact is too soft and the nut slips through
the flanks), and releasing the torque at the seat (driving a seated nut strips and bounces
it; releasing lets the self-locking thread hold it).
