## Suggesting Features

- If you have a feature idea, please create an issue labeled `enhancement`.
- In the created issue, please provide context, expected outcomes, and potential.

## Submitting Code Changes

- We use the `pre-commit` configuration to automatically clean up code before committing. Install and run `pre-commit` as follows:
  1. Install `pre-commit`:

     ```bash
     pip install pre-commit
     ```

  2. Install hooks from the configuration file:

     ```bash
     pre-commit install
     ```

     After this, `pre-commit` will automatically check and clean up code whenever you make a commit.
- (Optional) You can run CI tests locally to ensure you pass the online CI checks.

  ```python
  python -m unittest discover tests
  ```

- In the title of your Pull Request, please include [BUG FIX], [FEATURE] or [MISC] to indicate the purpose.
- In the description, please provide example code or commands for testing.

## Reviewing and Merging

- PRs require at least one approval before merging.
- Automated checks (e.g., CI tests) must pass.
- Use `Squash and Merge` for a clean commit history.

## Questions and Discussions

- Use [Discussions](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis/discussions) for open-ended topics.
