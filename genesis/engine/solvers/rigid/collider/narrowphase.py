    Recompute a perturbed multi-contact point exactly, by un-rotating the portal the perturbed detection found.

    Multi-contact spreads contact points by detecting collisions on slightly rotated copies of the two geometries.
    The contact normal and penetration must be recovered for the unperturbed configuration. The contact normal is a
    property of the Minkowski difference (both geometries), so neither geom's surface normal alone captures it.
    Instead the MPR portal - the triangle of support-point pairs bounding the contact - is un-rotated back to the
    unperturbed pose (each support point by the inverse of its own geom's perturbation), and the face normal of the
    resulting Minkowski triangle gives the exact contact normal, with the penetration as the portal's distance to the
    Minkowski origin. The position is reconstructed analytically on the smooth side.

    # keep the perturbed normal still yield an unbiased contact set: the per-contact tilts cancel in aggregate (no
    # drift), and the pruning kernel's mean normal averages them back to the true normal (the patch stays coplanar).
    #  - PLANE: the normal is rigid to the plane geom (geom A, rotated by qrot), so un-rotating it by qrot is exact.

    NOTE: for a single non-batched scene with a lot of collisioin pairs, it will be faster if we also parallelize over `self.n_collision_pairs`. However, parallelize over both B and collisioin_pairs (instead of only over B) leads to significantly slow performance for batched scene. We can treat B=0 and B>0 separately, but we will end up with messier code.
    Therefore, for a big non-batched scene, users are encouraged to simply use `gs.cpu` backend.
    Updated NOTE & TODO: For a HUGE scene with numerous bodies, it's also reasonable to run on GPU. Let's save this for later.
    Update2: Now we use n_broad_pairs instead of n_collision_pairs, so we probably need to think about how to handle non-batched large scene better.
