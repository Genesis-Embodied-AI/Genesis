"""Islands + hibernation showcase: a body comes to rest, hibernates, and stops costing anything to simulate.

Two scenes exercise the same pipeline:

- ``ducks``: a grid of ducks is dropped onto the ground and scatters. Each duck is its own entity and island, so it
  hibernates the moment it settles; the step rate climbs sharply as the pile comes to rest.
- ``dominos``: a spiral of toppling dominoes loaded from a single MJCF entity. Every domino is a free body of that one
  entity, yet each is its own island, so a domino hibernates whether it is still standing far ahead of the collision
  wave or already fallen behind it. Only the handful of dominoes in the travelling front stay awake.

While a body is awake the full constraint solve runs for its island; once it hibernates that island is skipped by
forward kinematics, forward dynamics, integration, and the constraint solve. The step rate is streamed to a live plot
and, with --record, both the scene and the plot are saved to video.
