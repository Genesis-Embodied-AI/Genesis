"""Describe a rigid entity: everything its simulation uses. That description suffices to create one.

Resolving what a parse states fills these in, and an entity builds itself from them alone: every field holds
the value it is built with, so a consumer reads a field and applies no fallback of its own. The exception is the
inverse weight of a link and of a joint: only the solver can state it, and its refresh completes the sentinel '-1.0'
at build. A link the world carries is the one case stated here, as zeros.

A built link, joint, geom or equality constraint keeps its description as 'desc'. The matching 'get_*' accessor of
that object returns the value the simulation currently uses.
