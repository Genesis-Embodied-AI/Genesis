"""Describe a rigid entity as its asset authored it, before the entity is built.

A parser fills these records in, and the entity builds itself from them. Each record resolves its own defaults on
construction, so a consumer reads a field and applies no fallback of its own.

A built link, joint, geom or equality constraint keeps its record as 'desc', where a quantity holds the value the
build gave it. The matching 'get_*' accessor of that object returns the value the simulation currently uses.
