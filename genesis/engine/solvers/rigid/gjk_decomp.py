        GJK algorithm to compute the minimum distance between two convex objects.

        This implementation is based on the MuJoCo implementation.

        TODO: This implementation could be further improved by referencing the follow-up work shown below.

        Parameters
        ----------
        shrink_sphere: bool
            If True, use point and line support functions for sphere and capsule geometries, respectively. It is more
            efficient and stable for shallow penetrations than the full GJK algorithm. However, if there is a deep
            penetration, we have to fallback to the full GJK algorithm by setting this parameter to False.

        Multi-contact detection algorithm based on Sutherland-Hodgman polygon clipping algorithm. For the two geometric
        entities that form the minimum distance (e.g. face-face, edge-face), this function tests if the pair is
        parallel, and if so, it clips one of the pair against the other to find the contact points.

        Parameters
        ----------
        i_f: int
            Index of the face in the EPA polytope where the minimum distance is found.

        Safe GJK algorithm to compute the minimum distance between two convex objects.

        This implementation is safer than the one based on the MuJoCo implementation for the following reasons:
        1) It guarantees that the origin is strictly inside the tetrahedron when the intersection is detected.
        2) It guarantees to generate a non-degenerate tetrahedron if there is no numerical error, which is necessary
        for the following EPA algorithm to work correctly.
        3) When computing the face normals on the simplex, it uses a more robust method than using the origin.

        TODO: This implementation could be improved by using shrink_sphere option as the MuJoCo implementation does.
        TODO: This implementation could be further improved by referencing the follow-up work shown below.
